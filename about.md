<p>Hi, my name is Thodoris (pronounced as Τhodorís). The name itself is an alternative and non-formal version of the greek name Theodoros and the etymology means "gift from God" ("theós" is "god" and "dóro" is "gift"). </p>
<p>I used to have software development on top of my life priorities, but software, as anything else in this world, has to do with people and when you want to coexist harmoniously with people, you also have to know how to behave. Having that said, I also write about life in this blog; many times with the format of simple quotes (of my own), in order to trigger the reader to further think about the saying, 'cause in the end , it's for his/her own benefit :-).</p>
<p>Everyone says he had a difficult childhood, so, what I'm only gonna say regarding those years of mine, is that I grew up with the <a href="http://www.exministries.com/truth-behind-hip-hop/">hip-hop</a> mindset; there are <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ol-aloudradio/i-am-hip-hop-ol-aloud-radio-1">some</a> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ol-aloud-1/i-am-hip-hop-ol-aloud-radio-2">leftovers</a> from that time.</p>
<p>Originally made in Greece, currently living and working in the Netherlands, still managing to go to the gym, despite the dutch rain.</p>
