<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Hello World!<div><br /></div><div>It's been a long time, since I uploaded my last post, but I had exams! Finally, I got rid of them yesterday, so I found sometime for myself, too; I decided to watch a movie that would make me think after the end, so I ended up with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0993846/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank">The Wolf of Wall Street</a> (it's going for Oscar).</div><div><br /></div><div><i>So today, this post, as you already realised, will just express some thoughts.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>The reason that I started with the movie, is that I just wanted to mention that <i>we all make our choices and probably are responsible for them.</i> A simple one, but I believe everyone who saw the movie, will understand.</div><div><br /></div><div>The other thing is that I started a new tutorial for the <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/" target="_blank">Java Code Geeks</a> community, which will probably be published tomorrow - it has to do about listboxes in JSF 2.0 .</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally, I'm planning to upload to my github account -probably tomorrow- 2 examples that deal with simple GUI applications in Visual Basic.NET; it was about a year ago, when a friend of mine asked me for help, in order to implement some programming assignments for a required for his studies course.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's all for now, have a nice and proactive day!</div></div>
