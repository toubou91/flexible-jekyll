<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">That's my very first post, so...Hello World!<br /><br />I won't introduce myself in detail, as you 'll find out many information about me in my social netoworking profiles; the only thing that I would like to express as a first feeling is to just excuse me about whatever you may not like and is related to the current blog's layout and "look &amp; feel" - I'm a newbie blogger, so be patient about it, please!<br /><br />I just want to mention, that the purpose of this blog is mostly to share programming and software related information that I find interesting (and to get feedback, of course) ; something tha cannot be done through social networking (except GitHub).<br /><br />To sum up, my second post will be related to <b>Primefaces 4.0 + JSF 2.2 configuration in Eclipse Kepler (v4.3)</b>.<br /><br />So, stay tuned!<br /><br /><br /></div>
