<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Hello World, exhausting day today; I'm always a night guy and it's only 9:35pm, but I'm saying it, 'cause I found 1 hour after my meal to have my shoulders workout done! I prefer working out late at night, but it was Saturday, so I didn't have many choices.<br /><br />Usually, after evening workout, I'm very tired and I can't do anything in the rest of the day, but today, thank God, I achieved concentration. Here's my today's "CheckBox Example with JSF 2.0" publishedÂ <a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/checkbox-example-with-jsf-2-0/" target="_blank">tutorial</a>.<br /><br />And a closing tought :<br /><ul style="text-align:left;"><li>I don't know the exact duration of this blog's ugly layout-design, but I really don't have any time; I also want sometime to improve it.</li></ul><div>Have a nice Saturday night.</div></div>
