<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Although during exams everything else, is very difficult to deal with, I yesterday decided to take a break from studying, by writing an example about <a href="http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/enterprise-java/radio-buttons-example-with-jsf-2-0/">RadioButtons integration with JSF 2.0</a>, for the JCG community.  At this point, I'm very happy that this time wasn't wasted from studying, mainly for two reasons:  <br /><ol><li> I got some serious troubleshooting during the tutorial's development, which I'm going to display in a new post, in order to help others that may face same problems, sometime</li><li> Despite this wasn't the first time that a product of mine was accepted from the wider community of Java, today I was more like happier, as a Java's twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/javanetbuzz/status/430936533785251841">account</a>, twitted the fore-mentioned example; a tweet that was favorited from <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/reza/">Reza Rahman</a>, a multi-dimensional professional and a Java Evangelist, working for Oracle, a person that I personally admire and respect a lot.</li></ol><div>Obviously, the above two-point-list isn't "catchy" for anyone, but encourages me to continue contributing to the software community.</div><div><br /></div><div>Time to study, have a nice evening.</div></div>
