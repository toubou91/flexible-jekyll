The answer to the title's question is just one line:<br/>
<em>Never do anything with a way that you never tried before, when time presses.</em>

Examples:
<ul>
	<li>you have an assignment and the deadline is already pressing you. Instead of wasting time on things like which technology/framework would better fit your case, just go for the solution in which you currently have the most experience with. It's not time to think about what went wrong and you spent most of the time you had on doing actually nothing</li>
	<li>you have an appointment and you go with the car. Your gps at some point suggests you of an alternative route, since there is a traffic jam. You listen to it, but in the end you appear in the appointment much later, since the "alternative" route was also about to face some traffic, by the time you were thinking about it.</li>
<ul>
