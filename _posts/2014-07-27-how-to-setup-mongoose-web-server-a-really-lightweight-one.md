<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Developing web applications always requires a web infrastructure, in order to test them, before getting them into production, but many times, we just want our app to consume a web service (that is, to be working as a client), so the requirements for a web server are very lightweight.<br /><br />If we aren't familiar with web servers and similar stuff and <span style="color:red;">we just want to quickly setup a server in order to test our web app's functionality</span>, <b>Mongoose</b> is here to give the answer, as it's the most easy to setup and use web server in the market.<br /><br />To quickly download and set it up, come along:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><br /></div><ol style="text-align:left;"><li>Visit <a href="http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml" target="_blank">this</a> link and download the Windows Executable that corresponds to free edition:</li><li>Add the directory path of the executable in the environmental variable called "Path" (if you need more assistance getting over this, please refer <a href="http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm" target="_blank">here</a>); for example, my executable's absolute path is <code>C:\Thodoris\Servers\mongoose-5.3.5\bin\mongoose.exe</code>, so I should add <code>C:\Thodoris\Servers\mongoose-5.3.5\bin</code> in my "Path".</li></ol>Good to go, just navigate to the working directory (folder) of your project, through command line and type <code>mongoose</code>; this produces a web server that runs and serves that folder as the web root.<br /><br /><i>Regarding the simple web apps that I'm developing over time for educational purposes,  I have set a global "mongoose" folder, where I place all the required assets. It lies under <code>C:\Thodoris\Workspaces\mongoose</code> directory andhere is a dummy view of it:<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://thodorisbais.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/e811f-dummy_structure.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="https://thodorisbais.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/e811f-dummy_structure.png" /></a></div><br /></i><i><br />So, let me run my server:<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://thodorisbais.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2f747-run.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="https://thodorisbais.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2f747-run.png" height="49" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />After successful execution of the command, server root in the default browser:</i><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://thodorisbais.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/345ec-index_chrome.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="https://thodorisbais.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/345ec-index_chrome.png" height="204" width="320" /></a></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>And it's not over. If you 're aware of host's IP address, you can ping it from any other device, connected in your LAN!</div><div><br /></div><div>Cheers!</div></div>
